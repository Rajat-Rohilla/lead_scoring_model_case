# Introduction
X Education is an online education company that markets various courses to industry professionals. Despite generating a large number of leads, the company has a low lead conversion rate of around 30%. This project aims to improve the lead conversion rate by identifying the most promising leads, also known as 'Hot Leads'.

# Problem Statement
The company wishes to build a model that assigns a lead score to each lead. A higher lead score indicates a higher likelihood of conversion, and a lower score indicates a lower likelihood. The target lead conversion rate is around 80%.

# Goals
Build a logistic regression model to assign a lead score between 0 and 100 to each lead.
The model should be flexible enough to adjust to the company's changing requirements in the future.
Data
The dataset consists of around 9000 data points with various attributes like Lead Source, Total Time Spent on Website, Total Visits, Last Activity, etc. The target variable is 'Converted', where 1 means the lead was converted, and 0 means it was not.

# Results Expected
A well-commented Jupyter notebook containing the logistic regression model, conversion predictions, and evaluation metrics.
A Word document answering all the questions posed by the company.
A presentation explaining the analysis approach and results in both technical and business terms.
A brief summary report explaining the assignment approach and learnings.
